// The guards that must be load-bearing, and the test that dies when each one is removed.
//
// A test suite can be green because it covers the code and green because it covers nothing that
// matters. The difference is only visible by breaking something on purpose: if a guard can be
// deleted and every test still passes, then either the guard does nothing or the suite does not
// check it, and both are worth knowing before a number goes out with the product's name on it.
//
// Eleven of these are named in the specification; the rest were added by work that came after it,
// and they earn their place the same way. Each entry says what to break, and which named test is
// expected to notice -- naming the test is the point, because "some test somewhere failed" would be
// satisfied by a typo.
//
// `tests/product/mutation-manifest.test.mjs` keeps this file honest: it runs on every `npm test`
// and fails if a `from` string no longer appears in its file, or names a test that does not exist.
// Without that, a refactor turns a mutation into a silent no-match and the report reads as a pass.
